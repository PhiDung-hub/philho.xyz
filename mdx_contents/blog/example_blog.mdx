# Get started

The most useful resource to kickstart rust development is [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/v)

## Linux, MacOS, or WSL2 Linux Distro

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

You should now be equipped with:

- [`rustup`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/) - Toolchain manager for rust programmign language, it enables you to switch between or update `rustc` & `cargo`.
- [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) - The package manager for rust, similar to what `yarn` or `npm` do for `node.js`.
- [`rustc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rustc/) - The rust compiler, it producees binary code from your source code. This is similar `gcc/g++` for C++, most of the time you don't invoke it directly but rather run & build rust program through a build tool (like `cmake`). For rust, our friend is `cargo`.

## Windows

Download the installer by following [this instruction](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). You should be ready in no time.

## Build from source

Clone the rustup repo [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup). If you didn't have `cargo`, double check `rustup-init.sh` script, execute it, then `cargo run --release`, else just run the command. More info [here](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/other.html#msvc). **Becareful! This will supersede any pre-existing tools chains**.

# First glance

We will scan through some important concepts of Rust. A good reference is [Rust standard library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std)

## String

At least multiple types of strings in Rust.

1. `str` - string slice, we don't normally use this, [refence here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html)
2. `&str` - borrowed string slice, made up of a pointer to an array of bytes. Data in `&str` is immutable. String CAN'T be index by
   character position (because Unicode characters may contain multiple bytes, what display is unicode graphemes instead of scalar/utf-8).
3. `String` - a vector of bytes, contains data, len, and capacity. Data in `String` is mutable.

| Example  | Description       | Rules |
| -------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| $value   | Lowercase         | ✅    |
| $Value   | Uppercase         | ✅    |
| $\_value | Underscore        | ✅    |
| $1value  | Start from number | ❌    |

## Ownership

Rust use Ownership and RAII to manage memory, no garbage collector is used => bare metal speed

There are 3 rules regarding ownership:

1. Each value has an owner
2. Only one owner - it can be borrowed.
3. If lifetime of value expired (go out of scope), it ownership is dropped.

An example of ownership:

```rust
int main() {
  let s1 = String::from("hello"); // Initialize and given ownership of this string
  let s2 = s1; // Value is moved here // ownership is transferred to s2.
  // println!("{}", s1); // Invalid since s2 ownerd the value now
  println!("{}", s2); // This is ok
}
```

## Pointer, Box & Smart pointers

All values in Rust are stack allocated by default (continuous, high-speed access, [more info](https://www.guru99.com/stack-vs-heap.html)).
Stack size is fixed so compilation wouldn't work for recusive data structures such as Linkedlists, Array, etc.. where
data size is unknown at compilation time.

Thus smart pointers are needed. 
For example, values can be boxed and allocates on the heap with `std::Box<T>`. A box is a pointer with automatic mememory management feature (hence *smart* pointer) to a heap value of type `T`.
- Conceptualize by C++, inspired from Simula67 `element` - a pointer without `null` ([history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_pointer#history)).
- For example, in C++11, `std::unique_ptr<Type> Func()` makes explicit that caller should takes ownership of the result, and C++ runtime ensures that memory will be reclaimed automatically.
- <strong>For Rust, </strong> a smart pointer is defined mostly as a struct that
  implements `Deref` - , `Drop` traits. The concept is well described in [official
  book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-00-smart-pointers.html). You may find this [explanation](https://youtu.be/KYJ95TxEC18) helpful.

An example of `Box` from the book, noticing box always takes 8 bytes.

\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x^2} = 1

```rust
use std::mem;

#[allow(dead_code)]
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

// A Rectangle can be specified by where its top left and bottom right corners are in space
#[allow(dead_code)]
struct Rectangle {
    top_left: Point,
    bottom_right: Point,
}

fn origin() -> Point {
    Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 }
}

fn boxed_origin() -> Box<Point> {
    // Allocate this point on the heap, and return a pointer to it
    Box::new(Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 })
}

fn main() {
    // Stack allocated variables
    let point: Point = origin();
    let rectangle: Rectangle = Rectangle {
        top_left: origin(),
        bottom_right: Point { x: 3.0, y: -4.0 }
    };

    // Heap allocated rectangle
    let boxed_rectangle: Box<Rectangle> = Box::new(Rectangle {
        top_left: origin(),
        bottom_right: Point { x: 3.0, y: -4.0 },
    });

    // The output of functions can be boxed
    let boxed_point: Box<Point> = Box::new(origin());

    // Double indirection
    let box_in_a_box: Box<Box<Point>> = Box::new(boxed_origin());

    println!("Point occupies {} bytes on the stack",
             mem::size_of_val(&point));
    println!("Rectangle occupies {} bytes on the stack",
             mem::size_of_val(&rectangle));

    // box size == pointer size
    println!("Boxed point occupies {} bytes on the heap",
             mem::size_of_val(&boxed_point));
    println!("Boxed rectangle occupies {} bytes on the heap",
             mem::size_of_val(&boxed_rectangle));
    println!("Boxed box occupies {} bytes on the heap",
             mem::size_of_val(&box_in_a_box));

    // Copy the data contained in `boxed_point` into `unboxed_point`
    let unboxed_point: Point = *boxed_point;
    println!("Unboxed point occupies {} bytes on the stack",
             mem::size_of_val(&unboxed_point));
}
```

```bash
Output >>

Point occupies 16 bytes on the stack
Rectangle occupies 32 bytes on the stack
Boxed point occupies 8 bytes on the heap
Boxed rectangle occupies 8 bytes on the heap
Boxed box occupies 8 bytes on the heap
Unboxed point occupies 16 bytes on the stack
```

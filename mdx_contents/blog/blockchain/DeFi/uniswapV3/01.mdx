# Introduction and resources

This is the first part of my series titled "Uniswap V3". First and foremost, here are some good references to get started:

1. [Uniswap V2 whitepaper](https://uniswap.org/whitepaper.pdf) and [docs](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/overview)
2. [Comprehensive tutorial](https://uniswapv3book.com/docs/introduction/uniswap-v3/) from [Ivan Kuznetsov](https://github.com/Jeiwan)
3. [Official whitepaper](https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf), [official docs](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/overview) and [source code](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core)

# Liquidity model

Comparing to Uniswap V2, V3 uses the same constant product $X \times Y = K$ curve.
However, Uniswap V3 augment the liquidity model, i.e. introducing new concepts to support concentrated liquidity provision.

## 1. Liquidity Amount

Let X, Y be the price of two tokens in a liquidity pool, respectively. Let's define the amount of liquidity $L$, represented by an **uint128** in Solidity, is defined as:

$$
\tag{1}

\large{
  L \overset{\Delta} = \sqrt{X \times Y}
}
$$

With same price defined as in V2 ($P = \dfrac{Y}{X}$), the following can be derived:

$$
\tag{2}

\large{
  \Delta Y = L \times \Delta \sqrt{P}
}
$$

$$
\tag{3}

\large{
  \Delta X = L \times \Delta \frac{1}{\sqrt{P}}
}
$$

### Proof (2-3)

For $\Delta Y\ (2)$:

$$
\large{
  \begin{aligned}

  L \times \Delta \sqrt{P} &= \sqrt{XY} \times ( \sqrt{\frac{Y_1}{X_1}} - \sqrt{\frac{Y_2}{X_2}} ) \\
  &= \sqrt{\frac {Y_1^2 \cdot X_1} {X_1}} - \sqrt{\frac {Y_2^2 \cdot X_2} {X_2}} \quad [X_1 Y_1 = X_2 Y_2 = XY] \\
  &= Y_1 - Y_2 = \Delta Y \quad (Q.E.D)

  \end{aligned}
}
$$

Similarly, for $\Delta X \ (3)$:

$$
\large{
  \begin{aligned}

  L \times \Delta \sqrt {\frac{1}{P}}

  &= \sqrt{XY} \times ( \sqrt{\frac{X_1}{Y_1}} - \sqrt{\frac{X_2}{Y_2}} ) \\

  &= \sqrt{\frac {X_1^2 \cdot Y_1} {Y_1}} - \sqrt{\frac {X_2^2 \cdot Y_2} {Y_2}} \quad [X_1 Y_1 = X_2 Y_2 = XY] \\

  &= X_1 - X_2 = \Delta X \quad (Q.E.D)

  \end{aligned}
}
$$

### Discussion: about Square root of price

All the above formulas involves $\sqrt{P}$ and $L$, a reparameterization from $(X,Y) \rightarrow (\sqrt{P}, L)$ would be an efficient approach for AMM internal operations.

During first days (back in Beta), V3 was using [`Babylonian.sqrt`](https://github.com/Uniswap/solidity-lib/blob/master/contracts/libraries/Babylonian.sol) algotihm to approximate reserve values.
**uint256**, **uint128**, and **UQ128.128** ([Unsigned Q number](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(number_format)>)) was being used for liqiduity and price calculation (see [PriceMath.sol](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/c09c892f59e08783e2415d1957c67979a4c7dccc/contracts/libraries/PriceMath.sol)).

[`SqrtPriceMath`](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/core/libraries/SqrtPriceMath) was first introduced on [commit 4724f148f5eb626d07d68e485a0a7a45103ee448](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/commit/4724f148f5eb626d07d68e485a0a7a45103ee448).
And **UQ64.96** was introduced to stores square root price, leading to more efficient storage and better precision compared to the model using old linear approximation (using Babylonian sqrt).

### What's concentrated liquidity?

Given that liquidity concept is defined. We can generalize it into all constant-function market makers (CFMMs) as follows:

1. Given a bonding curve of two token reserve $X, Y$ as $F(X, Y)$ - the liquidity distribution.
2. Divide the price range into a set of range $R$, where $R_k = \{ P \mid P \in (P_k, P_{k+1}) \}$. $R_k$ is protocol-dependent
3. $F(X, Y)$ satisfies the piecewise constant distribution w.r.t price:
   $$F_k(X, Y) \overset{\Delta} = L_k(P) \begin{cases} const, & P \in R_k  \\ 0, & Else \end{cases}$$
4. The full liquidity distribution is then: $F(X, Y) = \sum_{k} L_k(P)$

<Quote author="Uniswap V3 white-paper" className="my-2">

"...We call liquidity concentrated to a finite range a position. A position only needs to maintain enough reserves to support trading within
its range, and therefore can act like a constant product pool with larger reserves (we call these the virtual reserves) within that
range.

Specifically, a position only needs to hold enough of asset X to cover price movement to its upper bound,
because upwards price movement corresponds to depletion of the X reserves.
Similarly, it only needs to hold enough of asset Y to cover price movement to its lower bound.

When the price exits a position’s range, the position’s liquidity is no longer active, and no longer earns fees.
At that point, its liquidity is composed entirely of a single asset, because the reserves of the other asset must have been entirely depleted.
If the price ever reenters the range, the liquidity becomes active again..."

## 2. Tick system

A tick system granularize the price space into quantum range, where the automated market maker (AMM) follows $X \cdot Y = L^2$ as in V2.
Each tick represent a price range $R_k$ as defined in previous section.

As the AMM operates on percentage, e.g. fee is 0.01% | 0.05% | 0.3%, and we traders love using ticks. Uniswap V3 implements a tick system that is:

$$
\tag{4}

\large{
  Tick_{i} \overset{\Delta} = 1.0001^i \quad \text{[1 tick = 0.01\%]}
}
$$

### Tick range

As $\sqrt{P}$ is [$Q64.96$](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(number_format)>) formatted, the tick range is

$$
\large{
  \begin{aligned}
  [\log_{1.0001}P_{min}, \ log_{1.0001}P_{max}]

  &= [\log_{1.0001}{2^{-96 \times 2}}, \ \log_{1.0001}{2^{64 \times 2}}] \\

  &\overset{\Delta} {\approx} [\log_{1.0001}{2^{-128}}, \ \log_{1.0001}{2^{128}}] \quad \text{(for symmetry)} \\

  &= [-887272, 887272]
  \end{aligned}
}
$$

Same reasoning can be found in [this discussion](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/144793/why-does-uniswap-v3-use-ticks-887220-887220-to-represent-the-price-range-0-%E2%88%9E) (though the value was 887220).
And the [official values](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/TickMath.sol#L9) can be verified as derived.

### Tick representation

With this range, tick values can be packed into 21-bits signed integers.
Thus the [official implementation](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/TickMath.sol) uses **int24** for ticks (size should fit in bytes).

With the tick system, our next step is to provide a mechanism to manage liquidity provision between 2 ticks values.
For example, a user who wish to provide liquidity between tick $[-1000, 1000]$ suppose to trade their tokens and earn fee while $P \in [0.904842, 1.105165]$,
and do nothing otherwise.

## 3. Liquidity curve

With the tick system and liquidity amount defined in previous section. Let's _token0_ and _token1_ be 2 tokens in our liquidity pool.
The liquidity density, i.e. the amount of liquidity within a price/tick range (as defined in section 1) is:

$$
\tag{5}

\Large{
  L_k(P) \overset{\Delta}= \frac {\delta L}{\delta \sqrt{P}} \\
}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}

\text{where }
&\delta \sqrt{P} \text{ - quantum (sqrt) price range, i.e. a tick for V3} \\
&\delta L \text{ - amount of \textit{token1} tradable within range the range } [\sqrt P, \sqrt P + \delta \sqrt P].

\end{aligned}
$$

Then liquidity curve is the $L(P)$ curve.

### Uniswap V2

For V2, every liquidity provider is exposed to the whole $P \in (0, \infty)$ range. Meaning liquidity is evenly distributed: $L(P) = const, \forall R_k$.

### Uniswap V3

Liquidity distribution $L(X, Y)$ of V3 arise the definition of virtual (what's it would look like as if in V2) vs real (what's actually present) reserve

<div className="block md:flex justify-center align-center py-2">
  <Image
    src="/blogs/blockchain/uniswapV3/01/virtual_reserve.webp"
    className="mx-auto"
    wrapperClassName="pr-2"
    width="576"
    height="576"
    alt="virutal reserve"
    caption="Virtual reserve"
  />
  <Image
    src="/blogs/blockchain/uniswapV3/01/real_reserve.webp"
    className="mx-auto"
    wrapperClassName="pl-2"
    width="551"
    height="551"
    alt="real vs virtual reserve"
    caption="Real vs Virtual reserve"
  />
</div>

In short, Virtual reserve is the reserve in the pool if we extended it to infinity, whereas real reserve is the actual token reserves available within specified range, i.e. $[a, b]$

As mentioned in section 1, V3 liquidity curve is a piecewise constant distribution and can be visualized as follows:

  className="py-2"
  width="1500"
  height="600"
  alt="liquidty curve"
  caption="Liquidity curve [visualization from V3-whitepaper]"
/>

From this, we can also derived the global reserve of both token given liquidity within each range using formula (2) and (3):

$$
\begin{aligned}
X = & \sum_{i > k+1} L_i \cdot (\frac{1}{\sqrt{P_i}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{P_{i+1}}}) + L_k \cdot (\frac{1}{\sqrt{P}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{P_{k+1}}}) \\
Y = & \sum_{i < k} L_i \cdot (\sqrt{P_{i+1}} - \sqrt{P_i}) + L_k \cdot (\sqrt{P} - \sqrt{P_k}) \\
\end{aligned}
\\
\Large{
  \forall p \in R_k
}
$$

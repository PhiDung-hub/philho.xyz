# Introducing Uniswap V4

The official Uniswap blog made an announcement on June 13, 2023, revealing the public availability of Uniswap V4,
which is being developed as an open-source project. Uniswap V4 continues to follow the concentrated liquidity model introduced in V3,
but it introduces various improvements to facilitate additional customization and offer more precise control over routing and liquidity pool design.

Before we continue, I suggest reading the [introduction blog post from Uniswap](https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-v4) to gather more in-depth knowledge about the advancements in Uniswap V4.
The [draft white paper](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/main/whitepaper-v4-draft.pdf) is also available at the official v4-core repo.

# 1. Native ETH

A very exciting news of V4 is native ETH is available in trading pairs. This was the case for V1 but later versions (V2, V3)
forced ETH to be wrapped in ERC20 (WETH) to make it convenient and less complex for protocol implementation.
However, utilizing WETH incurred an additional cost of approximately 20K gas per trade.

With the introduction of singleton design and flash accounting in V4, ETH pairs will now be enabled.
The new library for token standard of V4 can be found at [CurrencyLibrary.sol](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/CurrencyLibrary.sol),
which is a wrapper around raw ETH address and ERC20 interface.
Further details on these concepts will be discussed in the upcoming sections.

# 2. Singleton

<Quote author="Uniswap V4 blog" className="my-2">
  "In Uniswap v3, we deploy a new contract for every pool, making creating pools and performing multi-pool swaps more
  expensive. In v4, we hold all the pools in one singleton contract, which will provide important gas savings because
  swaps will no longer need to transfer tokens between pools held in different contracts. Early estimates show that v4
  reduces pool creation gas costs by 99%."
</Quote>

Aside from singleton pattern, the pool design looks mostly similar to V3, evidently:

- [V3 Pool](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/UniswapV3Pool.sol#L379) implements concentrated liquidity, which is discussed in details in [part 03 of my Uniswap V3 series](https://philho.xyz/blog/blockchain/DeFi/uniswapV3/03)
- [V4 Pool](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/Pool.sol) will provides mostly similar functionalities.
  But now it's no longer a standalone pool so global fields such as observation details, factory or token addresses, and other redundant specs will be shifted to `PoolManager`.
  Thus all pools will now be managed by a single `PoolManager` instance hence the singleton design pattern.

V4 Pool will now store the following states (definitions similar to V3, check out [my uniswap V3 series](https://philho.xyz/blog/blockchain/DeFi/uniswapV3/01) for more details):

```solidity
struct State {
  Slot0 slot0;
  uint256 feeGrowthGlobal0X128;
  uint256 feeGrowthGlobal1X128;
  uint128 liquidity;
  mapping(int24 => TickInfo) ticks;
  mapping(int16 => uint256) tickBitmap;
  mapping(bytes32 => Position.Info) positions;
}
```

## More details about PoolManager

The PoolManager is still under active development, so a lot of change will be expected in the future.
Nevertheless, a few important details can be seen from the current implementation (**June 15,2023** at the time of writing):

1. [IPoolManager](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IPoolManager.sol), the pool manager interface, inherit ERC1155 - an alternative NFT standard to ERC721 - that supports fungible tokens within unique categories.
   Think of it as different items in a household equipment store, there can be multiple pots or cookers and each have their own unique ID.
   But essentially a pot is mostly (99%) the same as another pot.
2. Each pool is identified by their pool key:
   - Pool key is defined as:
     ```solidity
     /// @notice Returns the key for identifying a pool
     struct PoolKey {
      /// @notice The lower currency of the pool, sorted numerically
      Currency currency0;
      /// @notice The higher currency of the pool, sorted numerically
      Currency currency1;
      /// @notice The pool swap fee, capped at 1_000_000.
      /// The upper 4 bits determine if the hook sets any fees.
      uint24 fee;
      /// @notice Ticks that involve positions must be a multiple of tick spacing
      int24 tickSpacing;
      /// @notice The hooks of the pool
      IHooks hooks;
     }
     ```
     The pool ID is then determined by `bytes32.wrap(keccak256(abi.encode(poolKey)))`, view source at: [PoolId.sol](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/PoolId.sol)

# 3. Flash Accounting

<Quote author="Uniswap V4 draft paper" className="my-2">
"The singleton design complements another architectural change in v4: flash accounting. In previous versions of the
Uniswap Protocol, each operation (such as swapping or adding liquidity to a pool) ended by transferring tokens. In v4,
each operation updates an internal net balance, known as a delta, only making external transfers at the end of the
lock. The new take() and settle() functions can be used to borrow or deposit funds to the pool, respectively. By
requiring that no tokens are owed to the pool manager or to the caller by the end of the call, the pool’s solvency is
enforced.

Flash accounting simplifies complex pool operations, such as atomic swapping and adding. When combined with
the singleton model, it also simplifies multi-hop trades.

In the current execution environment, the flash accounting
architecture is expensive because it requires storage updates at every balance change. Even though the contract
guarantees that internal accounting data is never actually serialized to storage, users will still pay those same
costs once the storage refund cap is exceeded [5]. But, because balances must be 0 by the end of the transaction,
accounting for these balances can be implemented with transient storage, as specified by EIP-1153 [4]"

</Quote>

So flash accounting essentially reduces redundant transfers, making the protocol more efficient for sophisticated use cases.
The internal net balance is updated by `_accountDelta(...)` which stores the currency change in a Lock State.
This delta will be settled at the end of the block. Details implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/c019b0b3592c58271f4569da81ca1c340c004343/contracts/PoolManager.sol#L179).

# 4. Hooks

A major change in customizability of V4 is hooks.

<Quote>
"Hooks are externally deployed contracts that execute some developerdefined logic at a specified point in a pool’s execution. These hooks
allow integrators to create a concentrated liquidity pool with flexible and customizable execution.

Hooks can modify pool parameters, or add new features and
functionality.

...

We envision that future independent whitepapers will be drafted
for selected hook designs, as many will be as complex as protocols
themselves.
"

</Quote>

For now, some example hooks implementation can be view at [v4-periphery contracts](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-periphery/tree/main/contracts/hooks/examples).
With added functionalities from hooks, the swap flow will now be very flexible:

1. Invoke before swap hook (v4-periphery or custom)
2. Calculate token delta and swap fees, and update accounting states
3. Invoke after swap hook (v4-periphery or custom)

Details implementation at [https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/c019b0b3592c58271f4569da81ca1c340c004343/contracts/PoolManager.sol#L262](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/c019b0b3592c58271f4569da81ca1c340c004343/contracts/PoolManager.sol#L262)


# What's next

There will be a Uniswap V4 series once the protocol is mature enough.
In the meantime, have fun building!

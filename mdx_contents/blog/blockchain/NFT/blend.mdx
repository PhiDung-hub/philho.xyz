# What's Blend?

Blend, also known as Blur Lending, is a Peer-to-Peer Perpetual Lending Protocol designed specifically for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).
Since its inception on May 1st, 2023, Blend has rapidly established itself as a prominent player in the emerging "NFT-Fi" space.
At of now (June 20th, 2023), it commands a significant share of over 90% in the NFT lending market.

# How does Blend works?

Specifications and a detailed walk through are available at [Paradigm blog](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2023/05/blend).
Here, I will provide a high-level overview to give you a brief summary before we digest the actual implementations.

## 1. Fixed-term borrowing

If we would mimic traditional manner, it would happen in the following way:

### The flow

1. **Step 1** - Lender public an offer by signing it **off-chain**, at the same time, specifying:

   - Expiration time
   - Interest rate
   - Desired collateral

2. **Step 2** - Borrower who owns the desired collateral can choose their preferred loan and:

   - fulfills the lender offer, i.e. submit an on-chain transaction, place a lien against their collateral (the NFT) and collect the borrowed amount.
   - In case of defaults, i.e. borrower fails to clear the debt prior to expiration date, the lender has the right to seize collateralized assets.

### So what?

Given contracts being settled as above, these un-wanted circumstances will arise:

1. Borrower (NFT owner) forgets about the loan due to lack UX mechanism for notifications $\Rightarrow$ beloved NFTs gone 4ever
2. Lender wants to exist the position early or wish to change the loan terms, e.g. he foresee a potential L in the collateralized NFT collections.

## 2. Perpetual protocol

Blend solution is making the protocol:

- **Perpetual** by allow the contract to be refinancing. The refinance process can be conducted **anytime** as a [Dutch auction](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutchauction.asp)
  (on interest rate) on the current loan. Note that there's a cap of 1000% APY for the Dutch auction, beyond this the debt will be considered as default.

  **Example** You issue a loan of $4E \And 30\% APY$ for a Moon Bird to somebody. However, you see the bird can no longer fly
  so you wish to exists quickly before your borrower default. Since whole market expects NFT price to drop,
  you start auctioning your loan at $4E \And 20\% APY$ (cheaper at lower APY) and $30 \% APY$ increase per hour.
  While the auction reaches $4E 50\% APY$, somebody with higher risk appetite take over by paying you the current debt and becoming new lender.
  You have successfully liquidiated your position.

- **Liquidatable** by not implementing any auto-liquidation process, instead relying on refinancing auction.
  Certain thresholds are determined for the loan terms, such as:

  - Auction duration is capped at 120 hour (or 5 days).
  - Loan is considered default once auction expired (stop at max APY = 1000%)

And that is how Blend works.

# Deeper analysis

[Blur.io](https://blur.io) is not yet open-source so only the following details are available:

- Blend contracts (follows ERC1967 - upgradeable contracts)

  - Proxy: [0x29469395eAf6f95920E59F858042f0e28D98a20B](https://etherscan.io/address/0x29469395eAf6f95920E59F858042f0e28D98a20B#code)
  - Logic: [0x13244ef110692c1d8256c8dd4aa0a09bb5af0156](https://etherscan.io/address/0x13244ef110692c1d8256c8dd4aa0a09bb5af0156#code)

- Blend audit by ChainLight: [Audit_v_1.1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13rmzXIdy138gxPwiGNH8kk-yob4Bjzll/view)

Given the verified source-code from etherscan, I created a repo that tracks current stage of Blend logic contracts at: [https://github.com/PhiDung-hub/Blend_clone](https://github.com/PhiDung-hub/Blend_clone)

Now we will delve into Blend protocols implementations

## Structures

Loan offer and exchange order structures can be viewed at [Structs.sol](https://github.com/PhiDung-hub/Blend_clone/blob/main/src/lib/Structs.sol) and [ExchangeStructs.sol](https://github.com/PhiDung-hub/Blend_clone/blob/main/src/lib/ExchangeStructs.sol), respectively.

### The lending Marketplace

Blend allows user to buy/sell their loan and collect fees in a flexible manner. The order books is stored off-chain and managed by Blur.io backend.
Therefore Blend using [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) signature as an on-chain proof and every order input requires a salt identifier and `r, s, v` proof.

On top of that, Blend contracts require external oracle to fetch chain data so the signature of the oracle is also included.

Given all that, we have:

```solidity
struct Fee {
  uint16 rate;
  address recipient;
}

struct Order {
  address trader;
  Side side;
  address matchingPolicy;
  address collection;
  uint256 tokenId;
  uint256 amount;
  address paymentToken;
  uint256 price;
  uint256 listingTime;
  uint256 expirationTime;
  Fee[] fees;
  uint256 salt;
  bytes extraParams;
}

struct Input {
  Order order;
  uint8 v;
  bytes32 r;
  bytes32 s;
  bytes extraSignature;
  SignatureVersion signatureVersion;
  uint256 blockNumber;
}
```

### Loan Offer

```solidity
struct LoanOffer {
  address lender;
  ERC721 collection;
  uint256 totalAmount;
  uint256 minAmount;
  uint256 maxAmount;
  uint256 auctionDuration;
  uint256 salt;
  uint256 expirationTime;
  uint256 rate;
  address oracle;
}

struct LoanInput {
  LoanOffer offer;
  bytes signature;
}
```

Loan offer is identified by a unique salt and submitted to the exhange (Blend) along with a (EIP-712) signature.

Lender can specified their desired interest rate, and number of NFTs they want to give loan to. Since the offer can be partially filled, e.g. you giving out a loan of
8ETH for 2 Birdies but there can be 2 borrowers, so the loan offer keep track of `totalAmount` - portion give out for a particular loan, `minAmount`, and `maxAmount`

In summary, a high level overview of the loan flow is:

1. Lender place offer through Blur.io UI, and deposit ETH into a BlurPool.
2. Blur backend (**off-chain**) aggregate order book data and reveal offers to potential borrowers (NFT owners).
3. Owner can accept a loan offer by completing an **on-chain** transaction, effectively starting the loan.

_Note:_ A direct implication is only active loans (or the ones that are auctioned) are visible to external parties, else needs to be accessed via Blur API (not public yet).

## Interest rate calculations

Details at: [CalculationHelpers.sol](https://github.com/PhiDung-hub/Blend_clone/blob/main/src/CalculationHelpers.sol)

A few notes:

- To conveniently interact with ETH, arithmetics are done in Fixed point $10^{18}$ by [SignedWadMath.sol](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/blob/main/src/utils/SignedWadMath.sol)
- Like all marketplace, Blend use bips - $1 \over 10,000$ - as a basis point for interest rate calculations. Each bips corresponding to $0.01 \% APY$
- Max Yield (or auction liquidation threshold) is capped at $100,000 \ bips$ or $1,000 \% APY$.

When a loan is refinanced, it undergoes a Dutch auction. However, the auction rate does not increase monotonically.
Instead, the following scheme is adapted (see [calcRefinancingAuctionRate()](https://github.com/PhiDung-hub/Blend_clone/blob/main/src/CalculationHelpers.sol#L35)):

$$
\begin{aligned}

\text{Given that }
& T \text{ - The auction duration, \textbf{in seconds}} \\
& R \text{ - Interest rate specified by old terms, \textbf{in \%}}

\end{aligned}
$$

$$
C_0 =
\begin{cases}
  R < 150, & 5 + 2R - R^2/150  \\
  Else, & 5 + R
\end{cases}
$$

Then the auction rate with time is:

$$
AuctionRate_{t} =
\begin{cases}
  t < \frac{1}{5} T, & C_0 \cdot \frac{5t}{T} \\
  t < \frac{4}{5} T, & 90 \cdot \frac{5t}{3T} + C_0 - 30 \\
  t < T, & 1,000 - \frac{1,000 - (C_0 + 90)}{t - 4T/5} \cdot t\\
  Else, & 1,000 &
\end{cases}
$$

Intuitively, the rate comprises of 3 linear functions that:

1. **Quickly** increase during $0 \rightarrow T/5$ - "early bird" period.
2. \*Gradually\*\* increase during $1T/5 \rightarrow 4T/5$ - attract most buyer.
3. **Rapidly** increase from $4T/5$ until expiration - "last offer" period.

Auction rate (in %) variation with $R$ (in %) and $t$ (in hours) visualization is available at [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/urasr71dhb](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/urasr71dhb)

- X-axis in time in hours and Y-axis is rate in %
- Red line is new APY in %
- Black line represents the **refinancing premium** given loan amount is 60,000 unit, e.g ETH,
  illustrating lender benefit (or loss) if the contracts were refinanced at time $t$ vs doing nothing.

## Blend protocol

[Blend.sol](https://github.com/PhiDung-hub/Blend_clone/blob/main/src/Blend.sol) implements 3 flows that govern different features of the platform

### 1. Borrrow flow

This flows contains 2 basic function:

- `borrow()` - settle the loan offer by place a lien on borrower's NFT against the loan amount. This tranasaction determines the block where interest starts to accrue.
- `repay()` - repay lender and return NFT to owner

```solidity
function borrow(
  LoanOffer calldata offer,
  bytes calldata signature,
  uint256 loanAmount,
  uint256 collateralId
) external returns (uint256 lienId);

function repay(Lien calldata lien, uint256 lienId) external;
```

### 2. Refinancing flow

This flow describes different scenarios that lenders can start a Dutch auction to liquidate their positions.

```solidity
function startAuction(Lien calldata lien, uint256 lienId) external;

function seize(LienPointer[] calldata lienPointers) external;

function refinance(
  Lien calldata lien,
  uint256 lienId,
  LoanOffer calldata offer,
  bytes calldata signature
) external;

function refinanceAuction(
  Lien calldata lien,
  uint256 lienId,
  uint256 rate
) external;

function refinanceAuctionByOther(
  Lien calldata lien,
  uint256 lienId,
  LoanOffer calldata offer,
  bytes calldata signature
) external;

function borrowerRefinance(
  Lien calldata lien,
  uint256 lienId,
  uint256 loanAmount,
  LoanOffer calldata offer,
  bytes calldata signature
) external;
```

- `startAuction()` - lender can start the auction anytime by specifying the lien information and identifier

  - Note that the [liens](https://github.com/PhiDung-hub/Blend_clone/blob/main/src/Blend.sol#L21) storage varialbe (`mapping(uint256 => bytes32)`) stores the actual lien hashing by an `uint256` key, hence lienId need to be specified
  - emit event `StartAuction(uint256 lienId, address collection)`

- `seize()` - allow lender to seize the NFT once borrower defaults the debt. Lien is considered default if auction expires (guaranteed after initial loan expires)

```solidity
function _lienIsDefaulted(Lien calldata lien) internal view returns (bool) {
  return lien.auctionStartBlock != 0 && lien.auctionStartBlock + lien.auctionDuration < block.number;
}
```

- These provide different strategies that lender can refinance their position. All emit event
  `Refinance(uint256 lienId, address collection, address newLender, uint256 newAmount, uint256 newRate, uint256 newAuctionDuration)
`

  - `refinance()` - Renew terms if the current borrower accept it (verify by signature). **Must be called by lender**. New APY must not be greater than current.
  - `refinanceAuction()` - Renew the loan in an active auctiopn, effectively become the new lender.
    New APY must be below active auction APY, in most case new rate equals to active auction APY. Must pay old lender debt.
  - `refinanceAuctionByOther()` - Renew the loan that in an active auction to a new one. New loan must have the same duration and no worse APY.

- `borrowerRefinance()` - borrower accepts a new loan offer. Old debt must be settled in this transaction. **Must be called by borrower**.

### 3. Marketplace flows

This flow provides traders different strategy to participate in the NFT bond market.

```solidity
function buyToBorrow(
  LoanOffer calldata offer,
  bytes calldata signature,
  uint256 loanAmount,
  Execution calldata execution
) external returns (uint256 lienId);

function buyToBorrowETH(
  LoanOffer calldata offer,
  bytes calldata signature,
  uint256 loanAmount,
  Execution calldata execution
) external payable returns (uint256 lienId);

function buyToBorrowLocked(
  Lien calldata lien,
  SellInput calldata sellInput,
  LoanInput calldata loanInput,
  uint256 loanAmount
) external returns (uint256 lienId);

function buyToBorrowLockedETH(
  Lien calldata lien,
  SellInput calldata sellInput,
  LoanInput calldata loanInput,
  uint256 loanAmount
) external payable returns (uint256 lienId);

function buyLocked(
  Lien calldata lien,
  SellOffer calldata offer,
  bytes calldata signature
) external;

function buyLockedETH(
  Lien calldata lien,
  SellOffer calldata offer,
  bytes calldata signature
) external payable;

function takeBid(
  Lien calldata lien,
  uint256 lienId,
  Execution calldata execution
) external;
```

- `buyToborrow()` - Buy an NFT on Blur marketplace and immediately using the purchased NFT to take a loan offer on Blend.
  Borrower and lender must have some NFT deposited in [BlurPool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x02ab0463ca0c98de2d9b6649dcdb4ab667f12da7#code).
- `buyLocked()` - Buy a locked NFT in a lien. Price must be greater than current debt => repay lender and send surplus to borrower.
- `buyToBorrowLocked()` - Buy a locked NFT using `buyLocked()` then take another loan offer using the purchased NFT.

Those functions that are post-fixed with `..ETH()` simply deposit into BlurPool and execute the base function.
For example, `buyToBorrowETH()` deposit `msg.value` ETH into the BlurPool then call `buyToborrow()`

With these 3 functions, traders can speculate and profit from NFT price movements without the liquidity risk of owning an NFT.

# What's next?

Considering that Blur protocol has only been live for less than two months, it is reasonable to expect future upgrades and the emergence of new use cases.
As the protocol evolves, it will likely incorporate improvements and introduce additional functionalities.
In the meantime, invest safe and have fun!

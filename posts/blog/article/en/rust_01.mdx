## Introduction to Rust

Rust is a programming language that helps you write faster and more reliable software. Through sophisticated design, Rust gives you low-level control without the hassle associated with it. Read the nice intro [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch00-00-introduction.html)

## Get started

The most useful resource to kickstart rust development is [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/v)

### If you run on Linux, MacOS, or any WSL2 Linux Distro

For such Unix based platforms, rust installation is 1 click (or Ctrl-Shift-V) away. Copy and run this command in your terminal.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

**Through out this tutorial, all commands will be explained in details. Ignore them if you just want to get things run**

_The above command use `curl`, a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool to get data from URL via various potocol.
For the command above, by looking at the flag, we can determine it run on [HTTPS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-https/)
(`--proto '=https'`), using [TLS V1.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5246) security protocol (`--tlsv1.2`), run with silent,
fail silent mode on target [https://sh.rust.rs](https://sh.rust.rs). This will download a bash script (`.sh`) then finally execute it
using the pipe operator `|`. In the next parts of the series, I assume readers are familiar with `curl`. You can reference
[Basic usage](https://everything.curl.dev/cmdline) and [flags](https://gist.github.com/eneko/dc2d8edd9a4b25c5b0725dd123f98b10) at any time._

Most of the time, you will have `curl` installed by default (else, get your by following [this instruction](https://help.ubidots.com/en/articles/2165289-learn-how-to-install-run-curl-on-windows-macosx-linux)) and above command will get you `rustup`. Along side, you should be equipped with `cargo` and `rustc` then you are good to go. More about all these tools will be discussed in future series. For now, we know:

- [`rustup`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/) - Toolchain manager for rust programmign language, it enables you to switch between or update `rustc` & `cargo`.
- [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) - The package manager for rust, similar to what `yarn` or `npm` do for `node.js`.
- [`rustc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rustc/) - The rust compiler, it producees binary code from your source code. This is similar `gcc/g++` for C++, most of the time you don't invoke it directly but rather run & build rust program through a build tool (like `cmake`). For rust, our friend is `cargo`.

### If you prefer Windows but not WSL2

Won't be that hard, download the installer by following [this instruction](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). You should be ready in no time.

### If you want to build from source

Clone the rustup repo [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup). If you didn't have `cargo`, double check `rustup-init.sh` script, execute it, then `cargo run --release`, else just run the command. More info [here](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/other.html#msvc). **Becareful! This will supersede any pre-existing tools chains**.

## What's to expect?

We will scan through some of important concepts & features of Rust. A good place to references is [Rust standard library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std)

### String

At least multiple types of strings in Rust.

1. `str` - string slice, we don't normally use this, [refence here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html)
2. `&str` - borrowed string slice, made up of a pointer to an array of bytes. Data in `&str` is immutable. String CAN'T be index by
   character position (because Unicode characters may contain multiple bytes, what display is unicode graphemes instead of scalar/utf-8).
3. `String` - a vector of bytes, contains data, len, and capacity. Data in `String` is mutable.

| Example  | Description       | Rules |
| -------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| $value   | Lowercase         | ✅    |
| $Value   | Uppercase         | ✅    |
| $\_value | Underscore        | ✅    |
| $1value  | Start from number | ❌    |

### Ownership

Ownership is what makes Rust compiler run on steroids, making it one of the safest system programming languages out there.
There are 3 rules regarding ownership:

1. Each value has an owner
2. Only one owner - it can be borrowed.
3. If lifetime of value expired (go out of scope), it ownership is dropped.

An example of ownership:

```rs
int main() {
  let s1 = String::from("hello"); // Initialize and given ownership of this string
  let s2 = s1; // Value is moved here // ownership is transferred to s2.
  // println!("{}", s1); // Invalid since s2 ownerd the value now
  println!("{}", s2); // This is ok
}
```

### Pointer, Box & Smart pointers

All values in Rust are stack allocated by default (continous/linear, high-speed access, [more info](https://www.guru99.com/stack-vs-heap.html)).
Nevertheless, since the stack is fixed size so compilation wouldn't work for recusive data structures such as Linkedlists, Array, etc.. where
data size is unknown at compilation time.

- Values can be boxed and allocates on the heap with `std::Box<T>`, where dynamic memory
  allocation can happen.
- A box is a smart pointer to a heap value of type `T`. And a smart pointer is a pointer with additional features like automatic
  memory management or bounds checking
  - Conceptualize by C++, inspired from Simula67 `element` - a pointer without `null` ([history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_pointer#history)).
  - For example, in C++11, `std::unique_ptr<Type> Func()` makes explicit that caller should takes ownership of the result, and C++ runtime ensures that memory will be reclaimed automatically.
  - <strong>For Rust, </strong> a smart pointer is defined mostly as a struct that
    implements `Deref` - , `Drop` traits. The concept is well described in [official
    book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-00-smart-pointers.html). A [well explanation](https://youtu.be/KYJ95TxEC18)

An example of `Box` from the book, noticing box always takes 8 bytes.

```rs
use std::mem;

#[allow(dead_code)]
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

// A Rectangle can be specified by where its top left and bottom right corners are in space
#[allow(dead_code)]
struct Rectangle {
    top_left: Point,
    bottom_right: Point,
}

fn origin() -> Point {
    Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 }
}

fn boxed_origin() -> Box<Point> {
    // Allocate this point on the heap, and return a pointer to it
    Box::new(Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 })
}

fn main() {
    // Stack allocated variables
    let point: Point = origin();
    let rectangle: Rectangle = Rectangle {
        top_left: origin(),
        bottom_right: Point { x: 3.0, y: -4.0 }
    };

    // Heap allocated rectangle
    let boxed_rectangle: Box<Rectangle> = Box::new(Rectangle {
        top_left: origin(),
        bottom_right: Point { x: 3.0, y: -4.0 },
    });

    // The output of functions can be boxed
    let boxed_point: Box<Point> = Box::new(origin());

    // Double indirection
    let box_in_a_box: Box<Box<Point>> = Box::new(boxed_origin());

    println!("Point occupies {} bytes on the stack",
             mem::size_of_val(&point));
    println!("Rectangle occupies {} bytes on the stack",
             mem::size_of_val(&rectangle));

    // box size == pointer size
    println!("Boxed point occupies {} bytes on the heap",
             mem::size_of_val(&boxed_point));
    println!("Boxed rectangle occupies {} bytes on the heap",
             mem::size_of_val(&boxed_rectangle));
    println!("Boxed box occupies {} bytes on the heap",
             mem::size_of_val(&box_in_a_box));

    // Copy the data contained in `boxed_point` into `unboxed_point`
    let unboxed_point: Point = *boxed_point;
    println!("Unboxed point occupies {} bytes on the stack",
             mem::size_of_val(&unboxed_point));
}

Output >>

Point occupies 16 bytes on the stack
Rectangle occupies 32 bytes on the stack
Boxed point occupies 8 bytes on the heap
Boxed rectangle occupies 8 bytes on the heap
Boxed box occupies 8 bytes on the heap
Unboxed point occupies 16 bytes on the stack
```
